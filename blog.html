							<p>I have never blogged before, in fact the closest I've ever come to anything like this was in the third grade when I began keeping a journal. However experienced software engineers have suggested greenhands like myself should begin documenting their learning path to show experience when they begin applying for jobs in the tech industry.</p>
							<p>Now that I have been enrolled in a "Coding Bootcamp" for the past 3 months, I finally feel remotely comfortable with beginning this process. So bear with me as I begin to document my journey of discovering the wide, wide world of software engineering.</p>

								<p>I began the UT Coding Boot Camp in January 2017. While completing my undergraduate degree at the University of Texas, I took an “Intro To Programming” course, and I found it fascinating. I have always loved logic problems and algorithms, and this class finally allowed me to explore that more, so after graduating from UT in 2015 I began looking for ways to explore that more. I researched Coding Bootcamps across the Austin area, but realized many of them were full time, and due to financial restrictions I wasn’t able to commit to not having a full time job. However in the fall of 2016, I learned about UT’s night/weekend Bootcamp, and I jumped at the opportunity. </p>
								<p>I began taking classes and quickly realized that in addition to my love of logic problems, coding also would allow me to explore my more artistic and creative side with immediate introduction to HTML and CSS. I had taken some online tutorials in these two languages, where I learned about tags, classes, and IDs, but I soon realized that barely scratched the surface of the creative aspects of coding. </p>
								<p>It was within the first two weeks of the camp that we looked into established style sheets, frameworks, and Twitter Bootstrap in particular. Growing up I was always told to stay far away from using other people’s work and to avoid plagiarism in any form, but learning that in the tech industry this idea was almost non-existent began to open up many doors. We were taught that creating an entire website’s style without any sort of pre-established framework was not only uncommon but also irresponsible to your future customers. I never looked at these frameworks as a way to “rip-off” other’s ideas, but rather, I looked at them as a way to show my original stylistic ideas in a way that would be both aesthetically pleasing and also adaptable to both desktops and mobile devices. </p>
								<p>While the course has proceeded past HTML and CSS I believe it was good to reflect back in this first post to remember the very beginning of my coding journey. I hope to continue to post back here at least once a week. It may have taken some adjustment on my part to express my thoughts and reflections from class, but I believe it has been extremely helpful. I’m hoping this will be a positive exersize to expand my knowledge and comfort with the subject material.</p>
								<p>Anyways… Peace Out for now!</p>

								<p>When I first planned to do these blog posts I was going to specifically write about coding concepts we covered in class mainly as a way to remember concepts related to programming and programming languages. However, last Friday I attended a tour of Capital Factory in Austin that was accompanied by a guest lecture from Daniel Griggs from ATX Web Designs. We’ve had guest lectures related to programming through out this UT Coding Bootcamp covering subjects from Git Hub to Programming Resumes, but Griggs focused less on the technical aspects of his job, and more on the ideas behind his entrepreneurship journey.</p>

								<p>I’ve always been interested in entrepreneurship from a very young age. In fact when I was 12 years old and in the sixth grade, I started a lawn mowing business with my neighbor. While he was great with the lawns, the ideas of overhead costs, marketing, and reaching out to past and potential customers fell on my young shoulders, and I loved it. Obviously I didn’t know the extent of what all it took to run a business I enjoyed the challenge and developed a passion for working. I truly love to work. If I am doing nothing I feel extremely uneasy until I can do something, literally anything. It was my love of working that really motivated me to not only join the UT Coding Bootcamp, but to attend and focus on Griggs’s lecture.</p>

								<p>Hustle. That was the buzzword Griggs focused on through out his speech. Hustle. Griggs explained that through out his journey he went through 5 steps: Focus, Jump and Adapt, Read and Do, Call and Call, Break and Recover.</p>

								<p>Step 1 - Focus. No body has only one thing going on in their life at a time. As humans in the 21st century we have multiple options for how to spend our time. From jobs to hobbies to friends to passions, there is no shortage of options on how to spend our time. While it is possible to succeed in multiple aspects of our lives, if we truly want to excel in a certain aspect, you have to focus on it, and hustle towards it.</p>

								<p>Step 2 - Jump and Adapt. Rarely if ever will there be a day where you think, “Today is the day to finally take that step”. While signs from the universe are fun romantic notions often displayed in movies and television, the real world is full of complacency and comfort that draws us is with its soft and simple lulling. But if we want to actually make it as an entrepreneur then we have to break free from that complacent place in our lives, we have to jump into our passions, we have to adapt with the multitude of issues and challenges we will face, and we have hustle through them.</p>

								<p>Step 3 - Read and Do. Reading is a luxury that I took for granted through out my public school education. I loved to read. I would read anything from fantasy to historical fiction to even non-fiction essays. I loved to read. Now that I have real world responsibilities the luxury comes much less frequent. In fact in the past two years the only time I have been able to read is if I fly, and due to me being a recent college graduate with little to no extra cash this has happened twice. However, Griggs was quick to point out that reading is a necessity if you want to truly succeed in life. You have to make time to ingest the knowledge that comes from research. But it’s not enough to just read the material; you have to do something with it. While the “reading” often seems like the most challenging part of this step it truly is the “doing”.</p>

								<p>Step 4 - Call. In the first stages of any entrepreneurship project you likely won’t many pre-established customers, and without customers all you have is an idea. Griggs talked about in his first few months of designing website he would go to his local chamber of commerce, find the name and number of local business and cold call them. He would call dozens of business in a week and would likely hear back from a handful. This is when the hustle really happens. You can get discouraged, but you can’t stop. You have to put your head down ignore the rejections and grind it out.</p>

								<p>Step 5 - Break and Recover. The final thing Griggs emphasized is that you will be broke, whether monetarily, physically, or just emotionally. No matter what in any entrepreneurship journey you will find yourself in a valley, it’s just how it happens. This is when you have to recover and hustle like never before.</p>

								<p>The idea of hustling is simple. The action of hustling is not. It is easy to think I am going to put my head down and push through these challenges, but it is the act of hustling that truly separates successful entrepreneurs and people with great ideas.  Any time I have been asked to name my 3 greatest strengths I have listed charisma, passion, and diligence. While I pride myself on my passion and charisma, it has always been my diligence that I have used to propel me through life. However I have decided to replace diligence with hustle. It is easy to be diligent; you just continue to do. Hustling really embraces the idea that it won’t be easy. There may be occasional be highs, but the journey will mostly consist of lows, and it is only a true hustler that, like the Greek legend Sisyphus, can truly persevere and continue to push their own rock.</p>

								<p>This was a fun post to write. Likely in my next posts I will return to programming specific concepts, but branching out about a fascinating subject has been great!</p>

								<p>Well if you read this, thank you and peace out!</p>
